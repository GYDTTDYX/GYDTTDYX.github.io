## About

I'm a first year MS student at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Major in Biostatistics. 

## Past experience
I got my Bachelor degree in Bioinformatics at University of California, San Diego with Cum Laude Latin Honor. 

I did summer intern at Base&Byte as a Bioinformatics Intern. The working includes fine-tuning Bert-based model, Geneformer, to perform cell classification and gene perturbation on a TNBC scRNA-seq dataset. Also, my work includes comparing Geneformerâ€™s ability of removing batch effects with traditional methods like Harmony. 

## Interest
I'm interested in multi-omics analysis, especially tools using deep learning.
